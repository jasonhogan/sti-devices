Installation instructions for Pixis STI Device AddIn for Lightfield

The device INI files are:
*  sti_pixis_north.ini 
*  sti_pixis_east.ini
They must go in C:\Program Files\Princeton Instruments\LightField\AddIns\STI_Pixis
This directory is HARD CODED into the AddIn binary!  The north and east INI filenames
are also hard coded so their names cannot be changed.

An example INI is in the \doc folder.  Change the attributes as needed.
The module convention used by the AddIn GUI radio buttons is
* North = 0
* East = 1
The module parameters in the INI files should be consistent with this.

All DLLs should be 64 bit release builds.
