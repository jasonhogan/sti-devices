This is the code for devices used to drive an experiment.

The general structure of the experiment control scheme is that one or
several graphical client programs provide the user(s) with the ability to
edit text-based descriptions of the experiment cycle (=: timing-file),
display the experiment in a graphical way and run the experiment on the
hardware all via a simple interface. The clients communicate with the server
that has the job of parsing the timing-files, and of staying in connection
with the different hardware devices located on remote computers.  Finally,
there are different device programs (this directory), one for each kind of
hardware (camera, GPIB, digital IO, analog IO, DDS).

The device receives commands from the server and interacts with the hardware
directly. It should be the only bit that needs to be recompiled after a
hardware change. To this end, the devices can transmit their configuration
to the server as string-values.
